The data is a subset of a very famous chatbot dataset SQuAD2.0 whose description is given in the below link 
and can be downloaded from there.

I selected the data with tag "Beyonce" as a subset of the above data to run my codes.
I have attached a "data creation" file which includes the extraction of the subset and dumping into a json file and did some of the editing 
in the json file itself like adding tag of hi, hello, etc.
After these steps pre-processing and training model were done.
